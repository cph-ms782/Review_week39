#### CORS (meant for Thursday)  
Before you restart the server, monitor the request and responses sent to the server and explain how it’s possible to “break”

Go back to the terminal-window that executes your json-server backend. Stop the server (CTRL-C) and start it again, this time using this command:
npm run nocors
Test your SPA again, and explain the result.
