### Friday - Frontend exercise (last part of exercise from last week (thursday) - REST with JAX RS)  
 1.Implement a read-only page to show all Persons in a table. The table must be built in the browser using plain JavaScript, and data fetched via a REST call.  
****  

 2.Add a reload button that should refresh the page designed in the previous step. Use Postman to add a new Person to verify that we actually get an updated list (without having to create a new page on the server).  
****  

 3.Add an option to create new Persons (inspired by the figure below) on the same page as the one with the table. Use the REST API to create the new person on the server (hint-3).  
****  

4.Add an option to delete and to edit persons
