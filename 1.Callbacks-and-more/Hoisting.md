# Hoisting  
Team up with another member of the class. Read about hoisting and implement at least two examples (individually) to illustrate that:

 * Function declarations are completely hoisted  
_****_  

 * var declarations are also hoisted, but not assignments made with them  
_****_  

Explain to each other (as if it was the exam):  

 * What hoisting is  
_****_  

 * A design rule we could follow, now we know about hoisting  
_****_  
  
What is the difference between the keyword var and the ES6 keyword let?  
_****_
